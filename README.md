# üé® Image Generation using Stable Diffusion and Comfy UI

This project showcases an image generation pipeline using **Stable Diffusion** through the **ComfyUI** interface. The setup provides a powerful, modular environment for creating high-quality AI-generated images using a node-based workflow.

---

## üß† Overview

**ComfyUI** is a powerful and flexible GUI for Stable Diffusion, ideal for building custom workflows without needing to write code. This project demonstrates how to:

- Generate images from text prompts
- Customize workflows via nodes
- Load custom models and LoRAs
- Export results efficiently

---

## üöÄ Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Text-to-Image Generation**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable Workflows** via drag-and-drop node editing
- üß© **Model Flexibility** ‚Äì Easily switch between SD 1.5, SDXL, custom checkpoints, etc.
- üñåÔ∏è **Support for Inpainting, Upscaling, and Post-Processing**
- üìÅ Organized output folder structure

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for performance)
- Stable Diffusion model(s)

## üì• Model Download

Due to GitHub file size limits, large model files are hosted externally.

‚û°Ô∏è Download models from Google Drive [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aC_51w_0GxT96Fqz-o187RaBTaLYIftv?usp=drive_link]

Place them in models/checkpoints/ after downloading.
